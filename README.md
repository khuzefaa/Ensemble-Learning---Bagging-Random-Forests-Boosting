# Ensemble-Learning---Bagging-Random-Forests-Boosting
This notebook provides a comprehensive exploration of Bias and Variance, two fundamental sources of error in machine learning models. It explains the Bias-Variance Tradeoff and demonstrates its impact on model performance using polynomial regression on synthetic data. The notebook also introduces Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating),
