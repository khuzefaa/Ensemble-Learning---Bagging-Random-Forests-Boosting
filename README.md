# Ensemble-Learning---Bagging-Random-Forests-Boosting
This notebook provides a comprehensive exploration of Bias and Variance, two fundamental sources of error in machine learning models. It explains the Bias-Variance Tradeoff and demonstrates its impact on model performance using polynomial regression on synthetic data. The notebook also introduces Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating),
# Understanding Bias, Variance, and Bagging in Machine Learning

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook is designed to educate users on **Bias**, **Variance**, and the **Bias-Variance Tradeoff** in machine learning, along with an introduction to **Bagging** as an ensemble method to mitigate variance. It combines theoretical explanations with practical demonstrations using Python, scikit-learn, and matplotlib to visualize the effects of model complexity on performance.

## Prerequisites
- **Python Libraries**: Ensure the following libraries are installed:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scikit-learn`
- **Environment**: Compatible with Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
- **Knowledge**: Basic familiarity with machine learning concepts (e.g., underfitting, overfitting) and Python programming.

## Contents
1. **Bias and Variance**:
   - Definitions and examples of Bias (underfitting) and Variance (overfitting).
   - Breakdown of Total Expected Error: BiasÂ² + Variance + Irreducible Error.
2. **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**:
   - Explanation of the tradeoff and its importance in model selection.
   - Visual diagram of the tradeoff.
3. **Practical Demonstration**:
   - Synthetic data generation and polynomial regression with varying degrees (1, 3, 10).
   - Visualization of underfitting (high bias) and overfitting (high variance).
4. **Bagging**:
   - Introduction to Bagging as a method to reduce variance.
   - Analogy to crowd-sourced decision-making (e.g., movie recommendations).
   - Discussion of Bagging Classifier metrics (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC AUC Score).

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab).
2. Install required libraries if not already present:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
